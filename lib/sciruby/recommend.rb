    # Set Distance functions: determine distances between sets.
    #
    # These functions may be useful for k-nearest neighbors searches and expert recommendation systems.
    #
    # Sets are used for systems where vectors are binary. For example, if you have a matrix of customers and products, a
    # zero means the customer has not bought the product, and a one means the customer has. There is no concept of
    # degree.
    #
    # Pearson is probably the function most people will want to use.

      # Create a new recommendation-by-set-distance object. This requires as arguments two sets (+a+ and +b+) and a
      # +total+ size which indicates the number of items from which the sets are drawn.
      #
      # It also takes an optional +distance_function+ (e.g., :hypergeometric or :pearson). If this is given, the distance
      # will be calculated immediately. Otherwise, you can use the various distance functions to calculate distance by
      # a variety of metrics (e.g., distance_hypergeometric, distance_pearson, and so on).
